# Project Title

## Description of the Project

This project is advanced version of previously made Car Dealership application. Same as before, this application makes it easier for the dealerships to store their inventory and filter different vehicles within their inventory. Contract creation is the newly added feature for this version of the project.

## User Stories

- As a user, I should be able to enter the basic sales information, so the sales information is stored to be viewed later on for analysis
- As a user, I should be able to add a vehicle information to the contract, so I know which contract is related to what vehicle
- As a user, I should be able to enter if the contract is a lease or a sale, so I can get the related information to the contract
- As a user, I should be able to get the calculated pricing, so the amount due and other pricing details or known by me
